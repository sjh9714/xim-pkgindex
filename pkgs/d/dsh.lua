-- DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) — DeepSeek AI's open-source agent harness.
--
-- This recipe follows the npm package `@deepseek-ai/dsh`, matching upstream's
-- `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web` instruction. GitHub release/tag records now also
-- exist, but a GitHub-only release is not proof of a published npm package or
-- a downloadable platform binary. Verify the npm version before adding it.
--
-- No `package.ci`: version-check.py discovers GitHub release tags, which need
-- not exist in npm. Bumps are checked against registry.npmjs.org/@deepseek-ai/dsh
-- (`dist-tags.latest`) instead.
--
-- **Do not use `--ignore-scripts`.** The root package has no lifecycle
-- script, but its dependencies do: node-pty, koffi, protobufjs,
-- @deepseek-ai/dsh-subprocess-local and @google/genai. They own native
-- helper setup and the source-build fallback.
--
-- Older node-pty@1.1.0 tarballs had no Linux prebuild, so skipping scripts
-- left no usable pty.node even though `dsh --version` passed. Current
-- DSH 0.1.2-rc.1 resolves node-pty@1.2.0-beta.15, whose npm tarball also
-- ships prebuilds/linux-x64 and prebuilds/linux-arm64. Requiring only
-- build/Release/pty.node now rejects a valid installation.
--
-- The Linux post-install check therefore loads node-pty through its own
-- resolver: both compiled and prebuilt layouts must actually load. Missing
-- or unloadable native modules still fail. A source-build fallback still
-- needs python3, make and a C++ toolchain. Verify actual profile boot too;
-- `dsh --version` alone never loads the plugin tree.
--
-- **pnpm IS a dependency**, and it belongs here rather than in every install
-- command a user is told to type. `dsh plugin --profile <p> add ...` shells
-- out to `pnpm` off PATH — the CLI says so itself when it is missing
-- (`dsh: pnpm not found on PATH — install pnpm to manage profile plugins`) —
-- and upstream's own removal note is explicit: "Profile installation requires
-- `pnpm` on the host `PATH`."
--
-- The cost, stated rather than discovered later: xim:pnpm ships only
-- `pnpm-linux-x64` / `pnpm-win32-x64` / `pnpm-darwin-arm64`, so it is
-- `archs = {"x86_64"}` on Linux while dsh itself is JavaScript and runs
-- wherever node does. Declaring it therefore makes `xlings install dsh` fail
-- on aarch64 Linux, where it previously succeeded with plugin management
-- broken. That trade was made deliberately: an install that works but cannot
-- manage plugins is a worse default than one that says what it needs, and the
-- gap closes on its own the moment xim:pnpm gains an arm64 asset.
--
-- **No `xim:npm`.** node.lua's config() already does
-- `xvm.add("npm", ...)` and `xvm.add("npx", ...)` off the node payload's own
-- bin directory, so npm arrives with node — verified: the node payload ships
-- `bin/npm`. Declaring xim:npm as well is not merely redundant, it puts a
-- SECOND OWNER on the xvm name `npm` with a different version string
-- (`11.2.0` from xim:npm vs `node-24.19.0` from xim:node). Two owners with
-- different versions is the case the spec calls out as the dangerous one:
-- it is accepted silently at install time and only bites later, when an
-- `xvm use` on one side rewrites what the other side pointed at. Measured on
-- a live machine: `npm` already showed three actives across 19 subos in both
-- naming schemes at once.
--
-- (bun.lua and openclaw.lua declare the same redundant pair; out of scope
-- here, worth a follow-up.)
--
-- `xim:node@>=24`, and that floor is upstream's own, not a round number.
-- The repo root package.json declares
-- `engines: { node: "^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0" }`. The 22.x arm is unreachable
-- through this index: xim:node's 22 line stops at 22.17.1, which is BELOW
-- 22.19.0, so no xim:node 22 satisfies upstream. `>=24` is therefore the
-- only correct floor here, not a simplification of the disjunction. (The
-- PUBLISHED @deepseek-ai/dsh package.json carries no `engines` at all, so
-- npm will not enforce this for us — the dep constraint is the enforcement.)
--
-- Upstream is in *developer preview* and says so in capitals: "THERE WILL
-- BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES." Hence `status = "dev"` and the
-- pre-release version keys — `0.1.2-rc.1` is npm's `latest`, checked on
-- 2026-09-09. The separate alpha dist-tag is not selected implicitly.
--
-- Historical versions are retained because a pre-1.0 harness that
-- promises breaking changes is exactly the case `xvm use dsh@<ver>` exists
-- for. The 0.1.0-rc.3 pin was installed and run before it was written down
-- (`dsh --version` -> 0.1.0-rc.3): the `^0.1.0-rc.3` ranges its own
-- @deepseek-ai/dsh-* dependencies carry are satisfiable within the 0.1.x
-- line, so npm does not silently resolve an older root against newer
-- bundle packages. Anything below 0.1.0 is a different line (0.0.1-rc.*)
-- and is not tracked.
